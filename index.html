                    <p>Uploaded in this repository are two of my homework assignments from Algorithmic Design 2. Homework 02 takes in a text file containing different games, and the user provides input to find games based on name or company.\n
                        In homework 04, the program is given a board text file off user input and then the program has to move the "robot" from the start of the board to the end of the board without hitting any walls
